Childhood Stolen

A 2D game created for a university project during the course of C++ language. It was made with the Simple Game Graphics Library (SGG) (https://cgaueb.github.io/sgg/).

Concept inspired by Heaven Shall Burn's music video "Combat" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jCd-KTTR_I). Almost all assets are cropped by frames of that video.

Music Used: 
            
            Louis Armstrong - What A Beautiful World

            ZEAL & ARDOR - Sacrilegium III

            Iron Maiden - Childhood's End
